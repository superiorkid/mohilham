      Hello everyone, I am Moh. Ilhamuddin. I am a final semester student who is
      preparing for the final project. I like learning about computers. I am so
      interested in coding that almost 2/3 of my day is spent in front of the
      computer studying. That`s what I`ve been doing since I was in high school.
      I love learning programming languages and I always implement them in
      independent projects that I make while filling my free time so that I can
      improve my abilities and skills. Besides studying, I also like to play
      games as a distraction.

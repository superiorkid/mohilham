      Hi there! I`m Oleksii. I work as a full-time software engineer. In my
      spare time I do open-sourcing (normally it is about 1-2 hours in the
      morning before the work). Most of my open-source projects are focused on
      one thing â€“ to help people learn. You may use these projects to learn
      about algorithms in JavaScript and get prepared for technical interviews,
      or to learn Python syntax and start experimenting with machine learning
      algorithms and math behind them, etc. I also write articles about life,
      web-development and machine learning.
